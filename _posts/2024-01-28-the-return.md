This is the return of my thoughts to an online repository as I've been away dealing with new (to me) things related to home and work life balance.

Previously I was participating in the [#100DaysOfHomeLab](https://100daysofhomelab.com/) challenge by TechnoTime but work responsibilities shifted and my participation updates had to be put on the back burner.

However, that didn't keep me from playing around in my HomeLab. In fact, I've managed to move all of my services off installing to a single virtual machine to managing docker stacks using portainer at the moment. I even managed to migrate Plex from the VM to a docker container setup.
